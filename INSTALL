# Inslallation

## Prerequisites

You should have installed autotools, g++, OpenGL libGL and libGLU,  and GLUT (freeglut).

## Configuring

Run configure with the default arguments for your system, for example on RHEL/Fedora that should look like:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --sysconfdir=/etc

On Debian derivates tis may look as this:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr  --sysconfdir=/etc

If you don't want to mess up your system and don't have anything special about the required libs and/or build platform, just run

    ./configure

This will happily place everything in /usr/local if you do  __make install__ afterwards

Look at the configure output, it should contain lines

    checking for sqrt... yes
    checking for glPushMatrix... yes
    checking for gluSphere... yes
    checking for glutInit... yes

If sometring's not here, you don't have all the required libraries installed

## Building and installiation

After the successful configuration just type

    make

And, if you want the aplication installed,

    make install
